= Exercise 2 - Ad-hoc commands in Tower


== Section 1: Ad-hoc commands

For our first exercise, we are going to run some ad-hoc commands to help you get
a feel for how Ansible works.  Ansible Ad-Hoc commands enable you to perform tasks
on remote nodes without having to write a playbook.  They are very useful when you
simply need to do one or two things quickly and often, to many remote nodes.



=== Step 1:

To start, we will need to go to our Inventory.  So click *Inventories* on the left panel, and then click the name of our Inventory *Ansible Workshop Inventory*.
Now that you are on the Inventory Details page, we will need to go select our Host.  So click *HOSTS*.

Next to each host is a checkbox.  Check the box next to each host you want to run an Ad-Hoc Command on.  You will then see the *RUN COMMANDS* button become enabled.  Click it now.

This will pop up the *Execute Command* window.  From here is where we can run a single task against our hosts.


Let's start with something really basic - pinging a host.  The `win_ping` module makes sure our windows hosts are responsive.
This is not a traditional 'ping', but actually verifying both connectivity and authentication to the host.

Fill out this form as follows

|===
|MODULE |win_ping
|ARGUMENTS|
|LIMIT|(This will be pre-filled out for you with the hosts you selected)
|MACHINE CREDENTIAL|Student Account
|===

Once you click *LAUNCH* you will be redirected to the Job log.  Every job and action in Ansible Tower is recorded and stored.
These logs can be auto-rotated and can also be exported automatically to another logging system such as Splunk or ELK.

The first part of the log shows you the details of the job.  This includes information such as who launched the job, against what hosts, and when.

The 2nd part of the job log shows you the actual output from the command.  If your connection was successful, you should see a result such as this.

The results returned will be different depending on which module is used, as they all handle and deal with different data sets depending on the task.
No matter which module is used, you will always see a color coded STATUS of either SUCCESS, FAILURE, CHANGED, or SKIPPING.

=== Step 2:

Now let's see how we can run a PowerShell command and view the output using the `win_shell` module.

Let's fill out the form again, but this time use the `win_shell` module to execute the `Get-Service` Powershell command.

|===
|MODULE |win_shell
|ARGUMENTS|Get-Service
|MACHINE CREDENTIAL|Student Account
|===
Launch the job and view the results.  You will see that it returns a direct output of what the Powershell command returned.
This data can be stored to a variable and directly parsed inside your Ansible playbook later on.

And run it one more time with the `Get-Process` Powershell command.
|===
|MODULE |win_shell
|ARGUMENTS|Get-Process
|MACHINE CREDENTIAL|Student Account
|===


=== Step 3:

We will now take a look at your Windows nodes configuration.  The `setup` module queries the remote host for various data and returns that data as Ansible Facts.
This data is useful to determine things such as OS Versions, Hardware Configuration, and other various data points.
This can then be used in your playbook for all sorts of reasons such as determining whether a task should even run, or determining what the name of a package should be based upon the OS Version.


The `setup` module will run automatically at the beginning of every playbook unless told not to.  That way this data is always available to your playbook.


Lets go ahead and run the `setup` module to look at the output.  Fill out the *EXECUTE COMMAND* form again with this info.

|===
|MODULE |setup
|ARGUMENTS|
|MACHINE CREDENTIAL|Student Account
|===

You will then see results like this

=== Step 4:

Now, let's install IIS using the `win_feature` module.  Our arguments parameter is going to get a little more complex now.

|===
|MODULE |win_feature
|ARGUMENTS|name=Web-Server state=present
|MACHINE CREDENTIAL|Student Account
|===

You will notice that the log text is now orange.  This is to denote that a change was made on the system versus the green that shows that no changes were made earlier.

=== Step 5:

OK, IIS is installed now so let's be certain it is started using the `service` module.

|===
|MODULE |win_service
|ARGUMENTS|name=W3Svc state=started
|MACHINE CREDENTIAL|Student Account
|===


=== Step 6:

Finally, let's clean up after ourselves.  First, stop the IIS service.

|===
|MODULE |win_service
|ARGUMENTS|name=W3Svc state=stopped
|MACHINE CREDENTIAL|Student Account
|===

=== Step 7:

Next, remove the IIS feature.

|===
|MODULE |win_feature
|ARGUMENTS|name=Web-Server state=absent
|MACHINE CREDENTIAL|Student Account
|===

And now reboot the host.
|===
|MODULE |win_reboot
|ARGUMENTS|
|MACHINE CREDENTIAL|Student Account
|===

====
[NOTE]
The win_reboot module will cause the machine to reboot, and then will wait for it to come completely back up before finishing.
This way, if you need to reboot the host in the middle of your playbook, the rest of the playbook will not fail because the host is inaccessible.
