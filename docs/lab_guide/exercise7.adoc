= Exercise 7 - Using Ansible for Windows Patching

== Section 1 - Creating your Playbook

The `win_updates` module is used to either check for or to install Windows Updates.  The module utilizes the built in Windows Update service to function.
This means that you still will need a backend system like WSUS or the online Windows Update Servers to download updates from.
If your server's Windows Update configuration is set to automatically download but not install, you can also utilize the module to stage updates by telling it to `search` for updates.
We also have the ability to whitelist or blacklist updates.  For example we could tell it to only install one particular security update instead of every update available.


To begin, we are going to create a new playbook. We will be repeating the steps you performed in the earlier exercises.


=== Step 1:
Within Visual Studio Code, create a new directory in your git repo and create a site.yml file.

In the Explorer accordion you should have a 'student#' section where you previously made iis_basic.

Hover over the 'student#' section and click on the 'New Folder' button

Type `win_updates` and hit enter.  Then click on that folder so it is selected.

Hover over the 'student#' section again and click on the 'New File' button.

Type `site.yml` and hit enter.

You should now have an editor open in the right pane that can be used for creating your playbook.

== Section 2: Write your Playbook


Edit your site.yml and add a play definition and some tasks to your playbook.  This will cover a very basic playbook for installing Windows Updates.
Typically you would have even more tasks to accomplish the entire update process.  This might entail creating service tickets, creating snapshots, or disabling monitoring.

[source,bash]
----
---
- hosts: Windows
  name: This is my Windows patching playbook
  tasks:
    - name: Install Windows Updates
      win_updates:
        category_names: "{{ categories }}"
        reboot: '{{ reboot_server | default(yes) }}'
----

[NOTE]
====
*What are we doing?*


- `win_updates:` This module is used for checking or installing updates.  We tell it to only install updates from specific categories using a variable. `reboot` attribute will automatically reboot the remote host if it is required and continue to install updates after the reboot.  We will also use a survey variable to stop us from rebooting even if needed. If the reboot_server value is not specified we will set the reboot attribute to yes.
====


== Section 3: Save and Commit


Your playbook is done! But remember we still need to commit the changes to source code control.

Click `File` -> `Save All` to save the files you've written

Click on the Source Code icon, type in a commit message such as 'Adding windows update playbook', and click the check box above.

Sync to gitlab by clicking the arrows on the lower left blue bar.  When prompted, click `OK` to push and pull commits.

It should take 5-30 seconds to finish the commit.  The blue bar should stop rotating and indicate 0 problems...


== Section 4: Create your Job Template

Now, back in Tower, you will need to resync your Project so that the new files show up.

Next we need to create a new Job Template to run this playbook.  So goto 'Template' and click 'Add' again.

=== Step 1:
Complete the form using the following values

|===
|NAME |Windows Updates
|DESCRIPTION|
|JOB TYPE|Run
|INVENTORY|Ansible Workshop Inventory
|PROJECT|Ansible Workshop Project
|PLAYBOOK|win_updates/site.yml
|MACHINE CREDENTIAL|Student Account
|LIMIT|Windows
|OPTIONS
a|
- [*] Use Fact Cache

=== Step 2:

Click SAVE image:images/at_save.png[Save] and then select ADD SURVEY image:images/at_add_survey.png[Add]

=== Step 3:

Complete the survey form with following values

|===
|PROMPT|Categories
|DESCRIPTION|Which Categories to install?
|ANSWER VARIABLE NAME|categories
|ANSWER TYPE|Multi Choice (Multi Select)
|MULTIPLE CHOICE OPTIONS
a|
- Application

- DeveloperKits
- FeaturePacks
- Guidance
- SecurityUpdates
- ServicePacks
- Tools
- UpdateRollups
- Updates
|DEFAULT ANSWER
a|
- CriticalUpdates
- SecurityUpdates
|===

Now add another field.

|===

=== Step 4:

Select ADD image:images/at_add.png[Add,35,25]

=== Step 5:

Select SAVE image:images/at_save.png[Add,35,25]

=== Step 6:

Back on the main Job Template page, select SAVE image:images/at_save.png[Add,35,25] again.


== Section 6: Running your new playbook

Now let's run it and see how it works.


=== Step 1:

Select TEMPLATES
[NOTE]
Alternatively, if you haven't navigated away from the job templates creation page, you can scroll down to see all existing job templates

=== Step 2:

Click on the rocketship icon image:images/at_launch_icon.png[Add,35,25] for the *Windows Updates* Job Template.

=== Step 3:

When prompted, enter your desired test message

After it launches, you should be redirected and can watch the output of the job in realtime.
