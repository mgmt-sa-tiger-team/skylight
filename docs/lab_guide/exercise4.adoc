= Exercise 4- Creating and Running a Job Template

A job template is a definition and set of parameters for running an Ansible job.
Job templates are useful to execute the same job many times.

== Syncing your Project

Before you can create a job template with a new playbook, you must first sync your Project so that Tower knows about it.
To do this, click *Projects* and then click the sync icon next to your project.  Once this is complete, you can create the job template.

== Running a Job Template

Now that you've successfully created your Job Template, you are ready to launch it.
Once you do, you will be redirected to a job screen which is refreshing in real time
showing you the status of the job.


=== Step 1:

Select TEMPLATES
[NOTE]
Alternatively, if you haven't navigated away from the job templates creation page, you can scroll down to see all existing job templates

=== Step 2:

Click the rocketship icon image:images/at_launch_icon.png[Add,35,25] for the *IIS Basic Job Template*

=== Step 3:

When prompted, enter your desired test message

=== Step 4:

Select *NEXT* and preview the inputs.

=== Step 5:

Select LAUNCH image:images/at_survey_launch.png[SurveyL,35,25]

=== Step 6:

Sit back, watch the magic happen

One of the first things you will notice is the summary section.  This gives you details about
your job such as who launched it, what playbook it's running, what the status is, i.e. pending, running, or complete.

Next you will be able to see details on the play and each task in the playbook.

=== Step 7:

Once your job is successful, navigate to your new website (replace # with your student number)

[source,bash]
----
http://s#-win1.ansibleworkshop.com
----


If all went well, you should see something like this, but with your own custom message of course.

== Extra Credit

Now that you have IIS Installed, create a new playbook called 'remove_iis.yml' to stop and remove IIS.

**Hint:**  
First stop the `W3Svc` service using the `win_service` module, then delete the `Web-Server` service using the `win_feature` module.  
Optionally, use the `win_file` module to delete the index page.

== End Result
At this point in the workshop, you've experienced the core functionality of Ansible Tower.  But wait... there's more!
You've just begun to explore the possibilities of Ansible Tower.  The next few lessons will help you move beyond a basic playbook.
